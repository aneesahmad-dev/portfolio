# Total Blocking Time (TBT) Optimizations Applied

## Quick Wins Implemented âœ…

### 1. Script Deferring & Loading Optimization
- âœ… Added `defer` to `script.js` - prevents blocking HTML parsing
- âœ… Added `defer` to Tailwind CDN script
- âœ… Added `preconnect` to Google Fonts with `crossorigin`
- âœ… Optimized font loading with proper preconnect headers

### 2. JavaScript Initialization Splitting
- âœ… **Critical Path**: Only essential features (mobile menu, loading screen, scroll progress)
- âœ… **Non-Critical Path**: Deferred testimonials, achievement gallery, advanced features
- âœ… **Task Chunking**: Split heavy initialization into smaller tasks with `setTimeout(0)` yielding
- âœ… **Idle Callback**: Use `requestIdleCallback` when available for non-critical features

### 3. Image Optimization
- âœ… Added `loading="lazy"` to all non-hero images (profile, certificates, achievements)
- âœ… Lazy loading prevents main thread blocking during image decode

### 4. CSS Performance Optimizations
- âœ… **Font Display**: Added `font-display: swap` for all custom fonts
- âœ… **Reduced Gradients**: Simplified terminal board background (8 â†’ 3 gradients)
- âœ… **Simplified Filters**: Reduced image filter complexity (7 â†’ 4 filters)
- âœ… **Optimized Shadows**: Reduced box-shadow complexity on hover states
- âœ… **Will-Change**: Added to animated elements for better compositing

### 5. Scroll Performance
- âœ… **Throttled Scroll**: Use `requestAnimationFrame` for scroll handlers
- âœ… **Passive Listeners**: Added `{ passive: true }` to scroll events
- âœ… **Batched DOM Updates**: Group DOM reads/writes to prevent layout thrashing

### 6. Animation Optimizations
- âœ… **Non-Blocking Typewriter**: Async typewriter with yielding every 3 characters
- âœ… **Reduced Particles**: Particle count reduced from 50 â†’ 20
- âœ… **Visibility API**: Pause animations when tab not visible
- âœ… **Reduced Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

### 7. DOM Query Optimization
- âœ… **Element Caching**: Cache frequently accessed DOM elements
- âœ… **Batch Operations**: Group DOM manipulations in single frames
- âœ… **Intersection Observer**: Optimized with batched updates

## Performance Monitoring Added ðŸ“Š

- âœ… **Load Metrics**: Track page load, DOMContentLoaded, First Paint, FCP
- âœ… **Long Task Detection**: Monitor tasks >50ms that contribute to TBT
- âœ… **Console Reporting**: Detailed performance metrics in dev tools

## Expected TBT Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- Heavy JS initialization blocking main thread for seconds
- Multiple expensive CSS effects causing long paint tasks
- Synchronous DOM operations causing layout thrashing
- Unoptimized image loading blocking decode

### After Optimizations:
- âš¡ **Faster First Paint**: Critical path reduced to essentials
- âš¡ **Reduced TBT**: Task chunking prevents >50ms blocking tasks
- âš¡ **Better Responsiveness**: Main thread freed up sooner for user interactions
- âš¡ **Smoother Animations**: Optimized compositing and reduced repaints

## Lighthouse Score Improvements Expected:
- **Total Blocking Time**: Significant reduction from task splitting
- **First Contentful Paint**: Faster due to deferred non-critical JS
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: Improved with lazy loading
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: Better with optimized animations

## Next Steps for Further Optimization:
1. **Image Optimization**: Serve WebP/AVIF formats with `srcset`
2. **Code Splitting**: Separate achievement gallery into separate bundle
3. **Service Worker**: Cache static assets for repeat visits
4. **Critical CSS**: Inline above-the-fold styles
5. **Resource Hints**: Add `prefetch` for likely next pages
